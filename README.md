## 1. Situation

Investing.com is a financial platform and news website; one of the top three global financial websites in the world. It offers market quotes,information about stocks, futures, options, analysis, commodities, and an economic calendar. Most of the revenue is generated through advertising; Premium and Remnant. The Remnant business models are CPL / CPA / Networks. This implies closing many deals (Countries * Clients) on a regular basis. This may result in cumbersome processes for the team.

## 2. Techniques

The technique was to extract the relevant data from Salesforce using Python and SOQL and then display that information in an easy-to-read Tableau dashboard. 


## 3. Action

The relevant data was first collected from Salesforce, then processed in a Python script and finally displayed in a Tableau dashboard as part of full end-to-end ETL process. 

## 4. Results

This solution enables us to make operations more efficient and to improve the communication between the Business Team and the Operation Team.
